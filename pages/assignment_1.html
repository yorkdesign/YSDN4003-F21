                        <br><br>
                        The selection must respect the specific criteria of being an existing consumable digital product that anyone can access. It cannot be a fake, or early beta-access application.</p>

                    <p>There are various ways of selecting your application.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students can pick a current mobile application they use on a daily basis. It should be one that they have noticed something frustrating about and that – as a designer – they wish to fix.</li>
                        <li>A friend or family member who frequently mentions an application they use and complain about because of current limitations with the app.</li>
                        <li>Investigate Apple App Store/Google Play/product hunt for digital products with common complaints.</li>

                    <p>The design phase is a critical part of this assignment. Specifically, students will now increase the value of the current application selected using their design techniques.</p>
                    <h4 class="mt-15">Process</h4>
                    <p>A strong and thorough design process will be needed to complete this assignment successfully, which will include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A low-fidelity with user flow adjustment and paper mocks
                        </li>
                        <li>Mid-fidelity wireframes with digital black and white rescale mocks and an interactivity prototype</li>
                        <li>High-fidelity mocks with pixel-perfect colourful screens, an interactive prototype and animations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="black-box">
                        <h4>Attention</h4>
                        <p>It’s students’ responsibility to ensure that the final material simulates the real experience by leveraging design language, such as font, colour, components and visual esthetic.
                            <br><br>
                            If the gap visually between the existing and suggested design is too large – the final solution won’t be as powerful as it should be.</p>
